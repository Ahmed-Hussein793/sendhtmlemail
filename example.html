    <!-- 
        If you want to include images, you should set the src attribute to cid:unique_key. 
        Then, include the file name, file path, and cid in the files.json file.
        The JSON file should be an array. See example.json for reference.
    -->

    <img src="cid:example" alt="example">

    <!-- 
        Note: cid does not work with the href attribute.
        However, you can attach files like PDF, CSV, and TXT directly to the email 
        as attachments (not embedded in the HTML body).
        You can also use external links to include any file or image in your HTML body easily, like:
        <img src="https://www.example.com/image.png" alt="image">
